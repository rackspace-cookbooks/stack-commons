# <%= cookbook_name %>

Template for new stacks that includes best practices and default files for
Rubocop, Foodcritic (including custom [Rackspace rules](https://github.com/AutomationSupport/foodcritic-rackspace-rules)),
Rake, Thor, etc. Eventually, and ideally, this would be used by [stackbuilder](https://github.com/rackerlabs/stackbuilder)
to initialize new stacks.

## [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

See CHANGELOG.md for additional information about changes to this stack over time.

## Supported Platforms

Ubuntu 12.04
